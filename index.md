## Welcome!

We hope you will join us in Bellingham, Washington for 
August 13-18 for a week of activity (pun intended) on
stellar dynamos, rotation, and angular momentum evolution.

See the links at the top of the page for more info about the trip to Bellingham, and how we will organize our
time during this productive workshop.

If you have any questions, don't hestitate to contact Kevin Covey

See you in August!
